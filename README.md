## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Yâ€™Mauni Branch

I'm a business analytics graduate student at William & Mary, with a strong foundation in data analysis, strategy, and technology. I hold a Bachelor of Business Administration in Business Analytics with a minor in Data Science, and Iâ€™m passionate about transforming complex data into meaningful, actionable insights that drive impact.

With hands-on experience in both corporate and academic settingsâ€”including roles as a Business Analyst Intern at Elevance Health and an IT Risk Analyst for William & Maryâ€™s Cybersecurity Awareness Initiativeâ€”I enjoy solving problems, streamlining processes, and developing strategic improvements that make organizations more efficient and secure.

Currently, Iâ€™m continuing to grow my technical expertise through projects involving machine learning, data visualization, and predictive modeling. I love applying data-driven solutions across diverse areasâ€”from career development to digital risk managementâ€”and Iâ€™m always excited to learn, collaborate, and contribute to purpose-driven work.
